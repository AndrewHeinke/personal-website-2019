      Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. To be successful you’ve got
      to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. The weather
      is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this
      journey with me, Lion! I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth
      alert, cut from a special cloth. Don’t ever play yourself. Give thanks to
      the most high. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we
      have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat.
      Special cloth alert. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green
      because I ain’t give up. Never surrender.

      Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success.
      The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success.
      Take this journey with me, Lion! The key is to drink coconut, fresh
      coconut, trust me. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle
      to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! It’s on you how you want to
      live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean.
